# monsters-rolodex

This is Kind of my first React 'Hello world' Project!

it shows some monsters from the other page's api, and can search monsters using searchbar and react automatically rerender it for the correct information.

and it is guided from some lesson on Udemy lecture. if you want learn react, i highly recommend courcera's HKUST react full stack lecture or 

udemy's lesson. because, on there, udemy, or just in javascript world have very good and practical developer. and most of situation, on my opinion,

javascript is very focused on practicalism and also have to do. so,  and udemy is have a many practice focused lecture.

perhaps, in most time udemy is can teach you on a good way.
